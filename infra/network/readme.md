### Using the `AuthenticatedNetworkManager` with Different Use Cases

Now that we have the `AuthenticatedNetworkManager` complete, let’s see how it can be used in different scenarios.

#### 1. **Basic Network Manager**
Suppose you have a simple service that doesn’t require authentication, like fetching public data from an open API. In this case, you can use the basic `NetworkManagerImpl`:

```dart
final networkManager = NetworkManagerImpl(logger);  // Basic network manager
final response = await networkManager.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
```

#### 2. **Authenticated Network Manager for User-Specific Data**
If you want to fetch user-specific data from an authenticated API, wrap the `NetworkManagerImpl` with `AuthenticatedNetworkManager`:

```dart
final authToken = 'your_auth_token';
final authenticatedManager = AuthenticatedNetworkManager(NetworkManagerImpl(logger), authToken);

// Fetch user-specific data
final userProfile = await authenticatedManager.get('https://api.example.com/user/profile');
```

This will automatically add the `Authorization` header to all requests without needing to specify it manually for every request.

#### 3. **Caching Data with `CachedNetworkManager`**
If you want to cache the responses for certain endpoints (like static content), you can use the `CachedNetworkManager` decorator:

```dart
final cachedNetworkManager = CachedNetworkManager(authenticatedManager);

// This will cache the response for the given URL
final cachedResponse = await cachedNetworkManager.get('https://api.example.com/static/content');
```

Once cached, any subsequent calls to the same URL will return the cached data instead of hitting the network again, improving performance.

#### 4. **Implementing Retry Logic**
If you want to ensure that your requests are retried in case of failures (e.g., network issues), you can wrap the network manager with a `RetryStrategy`:

```dart
final retryStrategy = SimpleRetryStrategy(maxAttempts: 3, delay: Duration(seconds: 2));

// Retry wrapper around the base network manager
final retryingManager = RetryNetworkManager(cachedNetworkManager, retryStrategy);

try {
  final response = await retryingManager.get('https://api.example.com/retry-endpoint');
} catch (e) {
  print('Request failed after retries: $e');
}
```

This setup will attempt to make the request up to 3 times, with a delay of 2 seconds between each attempt.

#### 5. **Handling Circuit Breaker for Unstable Services**
If an external API is unstable and you want to avoid overloading it with requests, you can implement a `CircuitBreaker`:

```dart
final circuitBreaker = CircuitBreaker(failureThreshold: 3, timeout: Duration(seconds: 30));
final circuitBreakingManager = CircuitBreakerNetworkManager(retryingManager, circuitBreaker);

try {
  final response = await circuitBreakingManager.get('https://api.example.com/unstable-endpoint');
} catch (e) {
  print('Circuit breaker triggered: $e');
}
```

If the request fails more than 3 times, the circuit breaker will open, and no further requests will be made to this endpoint until the timeout period expires.

#### 6. **Pagination for Large Datasets**
For paginated APIs, implement a `PaginatedNetworkManager` to handle fetching data page by page:

```dart
final paginatedManager = PaginatedNetworkManagerImpl(NetworkManagerImpl(logger));

final firstPage = await paginatedManager.fetchPaginatedData('https://api.example.com/data', page: 1);
print('Page 1 data: ${firstPage.data}');

final secondPage = await paginatedManager.fetchPaginatedData('https://api.example.com/data', page: 2);
print('Page 2 data: ${secondPage.data}');
```

### Summary of How to Use Each Class

- **`NetworkManagerImpl`**: Basic HTTP client for unauthenticated requests.
- **`AuthenticatedNetworkManager`**: Extends `NetworkManager` to add `Authorization` headers for authenticated APIs.
- **`CachedNetworkManager`**: Adds caching capabilities for GET requests.
- **`RetryNetworkManager`**: Adds retry logic for handling transient failures.
- **`CircuitBreakerNetworkManager`**: Adds a circuit breaker to prevent overloading of unstable services.
- **`PaginatedNetworkManager`**: Handles paginated data retrieval.

### Putting It All Together
You can create a **composite network manager** that combines all these functionalities:

```dart
final networkManager = NetworkManagerImpl(logger);
final authenticatedManager = AuthenticatedNetworkManager(networkManager, 'your_auth_token');
final cachedManager = CachedNetworkManager(authenticatedManager);
final retryingManager = RetryNetworkManager(cachedManager, SimpleRetryStrategy());
final circuitBreakingManager = CircuitBreakerNetworkManager(retryingManager, CircuitBreaker());

// Use the final network manager
final response = await circuitBreakingManager.get('https://api.example.com/some-endpoint');
```

### Why This Structure?
1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each manager focuses on one aspect (authentication, caching, retry logic).
2. **Open/Closed Principle**: Easily extend the functionality (e.g., add new decorators) without modifying existing code.
3. **Dependency Inversion Principle**: High-level components depend on abstractions (interfaces) rather than concrete implementations.
4. **Decorator Pattern**: Used for adding optional behaviors (e.g., caching).
5. **Strategy Pattern**: Used for implementing different retry strategies.

By building your network manager with these principles and patterns, you create a **modular**, **extensible**, and **testable** system that can adapt to various use cases.
